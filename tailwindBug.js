This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js where the class names are not properly purged or optimized during the build process.  This can lead to significantly larger CSS files than expected, impacting performance. The issue may manifest as slow initial load times or increased bundle size. In some cases, it can also result in incorrect styling or missing styles if some stylesheets were purged or minified improperly.
