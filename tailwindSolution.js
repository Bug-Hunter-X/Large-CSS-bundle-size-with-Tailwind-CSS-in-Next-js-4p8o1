In `tailwind.config.js`, ensure that the `purge` option is correctly configured to point to all your template files.  Also, consider using the `content` option with glob patterns for more precise purging. Consider enabling minification during production build. 
```javascript
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js'], // Adjust paths as needed
  // Or alternatively for more dynamic content:
  // content: [ 
  //   './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', 
  //   './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', 
  // ],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class' 
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
Use a more specific selector in your CSS classes in the project components to reduce the number of unnecessary CSS rules generated. 
Ensure you are building your application for production (`npm run build` or similar), as build optimizations are usually done only in production mode.
